<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hii I'm Manyata Singh and I'm a student. 
   I'm currently pursuing my undergrad BTECH degree in Computer Science. Since Computer Science is a very innovative and explorive field and i love exploring new things that's the reason of me choosing this field.
   I have taken an online course of Web development BootCamp and so far i loved this course and I'm very much excited to know about all the upcoming lessons.</p>
